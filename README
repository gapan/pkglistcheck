pkglistcheck is a small command line tool that can be used to check
Salix ISO package lists for problems.

pkglistcheck should be run from inside the directory that has the
package list files. A file named "CORE" should always be present in that
directory.

You should make sure that your /var/slapt-get/package_data file is up to
date by running:
  slapt-get --update

Note that results might be slightly different if run from a 32-bit or a
64-bit installation.
